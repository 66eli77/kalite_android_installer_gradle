# kalite_android_installer_gradle
This project is partly an effort to create a CI build server for kalite android installer. Another reason to imgrate to Gradle is that since Android 5.0, we need a different Python Build to run Ka-Lite. Gradle's better support for flavor will make the APK generating process more streamlined.
In the future, our next gen platform Kolibri will have much better support for plug-in. Gradle will faciliate the possibility of having many different versions of Android installer to meet different user needs.
